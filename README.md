A chill guide to get started with XGboost


## Feature Importance
Helps determine which features has a high corrlelation with the target values 

This is calculated from a trained model 
## Learning Curve 
Determines if the model is over, under, or good fit. 

Can also help determine if the dataset is unrepresented.

## Time series based XGBoost VS Regression based XGBoost
Both traditional regression-based XGBoost and time series-based XGBoost models have their merits and can be effective for predicting oil prices, depending on the specific characteristics of your data and your modeling goals. Let's explore the advantages of each approach:

**Regression XGBoost**:

1. **Flexibility**: Regression-based XGBoost can handle a wide range of predictive modeling tasks, not limited to time series data. If your dataset contains features beyond time-related variables, regression XGBoost can leverage them effectively.

2. **Feature Importance**: XGBoost provides feature importance scores, which can help you understand which features contribute the most to the prediction. This can be valuable for interpreting the model's behavior and gaining insights into the relationship between features and oil prices.

3. **Complex Relationships**: If the relationships between macroeconomic features and oil prices are complex and involve interactions that go beyond time dependencies, regression XGBoost might capture these relationships well.

**Time Series XGBoost**:

1. **Temporal Dependencies**: Time series-based XGBoost models, such as using lagged variables and previous oil prices as features, are explicitly designed to capture temporal dependencies. This can be crucial if the primary factors affecting oil prices are related to past prices and seasonality.

2. **Seasonality**: Time series XGBoost models can handle seasonality patterns and other temporal variations more effectively. If oil prices have strong cyclical patterns, a time series approach can be more appropriate.

3. **Interpolation**: Time series models can interpolate missing values in a time series, which is useful if you have gaps in your historical data.

In practice, the best approach might involve combining both. You can use a time series XGBoost model to capture temporal dependencies, seasonality, and patterns specific to oil prices. Then, you can incorporate macroeconomic features using regression XGBoost as additional inputs to enhance the model's predictive power.

Before deciding, it's recommended to experiment with both approaches, validate them on hold-out datasets, and compare their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics. The choice between regression XGBoost and time series XGBoost should be based on how well each approach addresses the unique characteristics of your data and the accuracy of predictions you achieve.
## Finding Accuracy 
- MSE and RMSE
# Loose steps to follow when starting:
## 1. Data Preprocessing
- Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies.
- Normalize or standardize the features to ensure they are on similar scales.
- If your data includes time series features (e.g., historical employment rate), consider creating lag features to capture temporal dependencies.
## 2. Feature Selection /Extraction
- Given the large number of features, you might want to perform feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques to identify the most relevant features. Techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), feature importance from tree-based models, or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) could be helpful.
## 3. Time series Analysis
- Analyze the temporal patterns in your oil price data. Look for trends, seasonality, and any other patterns that could help inform your modeling approach.
## 4. Modeling
- Try different algorithms and models to see which performs best with your dataset. Some options to consider:
    - LSTM/GRU Networks: Neural networks with sequences as inputs can capture temporal patterns effectively.
    - Time Series Models: ARIMA, SARIMA, or other time series models that handle seasonality and trends.
    - Random Forests or Gradient Boosting: These ensemble methods can capture complex interactions between features.
    - XGBoost/LightGBM: These gradient boosting frameworks can handle large datasets and complex relationships.
    - Prophet: Especially useful if you have strong seasonality and multiple seasonal effects.
## 5. Cross-Validation and Evaluation:
- Split your data into training and testing sets (or consider time-based cross-validation for time series data).
- Evaluate your models using appropriate metrics for time series data, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and potentially metrics that account for direction like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
## 6. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Fine-tune hyperparameters of your chosen models to improve performance.
## 7. Ensemble Techniques
- You can also consider ensembling multiple models together to leverage the strengths of different algorithms.
## 8. Monitor and Refine
- Periodically evaluate your model's performance as new data becomes available. Update and retrain your model as necessary to keep it accurate.
